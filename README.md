### End Notes ðŸ“‘

In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

### Limitations:

All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
